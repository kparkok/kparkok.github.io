## Proposers:
Karina Park-Okuna

## Problem: 
Navigating and fully engaging with campus life can be challenging, often leaving students feeling overwhelmed by the variety of events, resources, and opportunities available. On the other hand, some students may not be aware of all their campus has to offer, leading them to miss out on valuable experiences. Additionally, campus organizations and services may struggle to effectively reach students, resulting in lower engagement in events, activities, and resources.

## Solution: 
A web app designed to improve the college experience by centralizing resources, fostering student connections, and providing tailored support for academic, social, and personal well-being. The app will serve as a one-stop hub for students to access campus resources, find events, join interest-based communities, and explore student-driven initiatives. It should also allow students to create an account to further view, register for, and get reminders for upcoming events, while allowing event organizers to create and manage event details. 

## Mockup page ideas:
The page will feature a navigational bar allowing users to log in to their accounts and access essential sections: a Home Event Dashboard showcasing featured and upcoming events, an interactive Event Calendar, a Resource Hub with key campus services, and a searchable directory of student organizations and clubs. Each section provides quick, organized access to enhance students' connection to campus life.

## Use case ideas:
1. New Student Looking for Involvement:
   The student uses the app to discover clubs, browse upcoming social events, and find resources for academic support. Helping them feel integrated and aware of whatâ€™s available.
2. Mental Health Check:
   A student struggling with a busy schedule accesses the Wellness Dashboard, finds suggestions for campus wellness resources, and registers for an upcoming mindfulness workshop.

## Beyond the basics:
1. Campus Navigation: Navigational feature for campus locationa
2. Point System: Students can earn points by being active in events, clubs and using campus resources.
3. Personalized Event Reccomendations
