## UI Frameworks: Bootstrap

When I first started learning about web development with HTML and CSS, it seemed pretty straightforward. I understood the elements of a basic webpage and was able to style it how I envisioned it. Then Bootstrap 5 was introduced and for a little while things were a bit more complicated. Bootstrap 5 is a UI framework and at first it was hard incorporating the elements of Bootstrap into my work when I had just gotten the basics of HTML and CSS but after spending some time learning, I believe that learning Bootstrap 5 is worth the time.

So what is Bootstrap? Bootstrap is an open-source UI framework created and designed to simplify the process of building responsible web applications. It provides a collection of pre-designed components that are all customizable and can be easily integrated into a website using its simple class names. What’s cool about Bootstrap is that it comes with built-in CSS and JavaScript which makes it easy to incorporate without having to write extensive code. As a beginner, Bootstrap’s ready-made tools significantly sped up my learning process and my understanding.

I had the intention that having to build websites meant having to write every single aspect and line of HTML and CSS, starting from nothing. But after learning about frameworks such as Bootstrap, I feel more confident in my learning, my work and I feel more prepared. With Bootstrap, you don't need to create anything from scratch. Navigation bars, sizes, spacing, colors, are all covered by Bootstrap. Instead you are able to use their simple classes such as “btn btn-primary” to instantly create a professional looking button.

Bootstrap makes your work process so much cleaner and more efficient. You do not have to worry about the consistency across browsers, it has a responsive design which means consistency across devices as well and it automatically adjusts. I haven't run into this as a problem yet but I understand how much of a game changer Bootstrap will be for the future of my work.

Bootstrap is a bit of a learning curve and takes a lot of repetition and uses of its classes and components but overall makes a more efficient developer and allows you to focus more on the creative aspects. I have a lot more to learn, even beyond bootstrap, but this is something that I will keep close as a skill as I continue to become a better developer.
