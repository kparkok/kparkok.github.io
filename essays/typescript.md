Before taking ICS 314, I had never heard of TypeScript and this class was my first introduction to it. From what I’ve learned so far, my understanding is that TypeScrip enforces static typing which overall improves safety. It is also a superset of JavaScript and runs in the same environments but enhances Javascript for developers by allowing them to define types for variables, functions, parameters, and return values. This is very important because it helps catch type errors early on, improves code readability and increases its maintainability. Although I have not worked that much with TypeScript yet, I can already see why it can be considered a good programming language. One area I am particularly interested in exploring is how TypeScript benefits collaboration in larger teams. I think that while working with others it is common to not have a clear understanding of all work, but TypeScript is meant to enhance code readability and understanding. I look forward to gaining more experience with this aspect of TypeScript as I continue using it.
I think the term “athletic software engineering” is a great term, to think about practice and training in relation to academics makes a lot of sense to me. Taking the time to work on smaller problems in repetition and practice WODs prepares me for each week, boosts my understanding and gets me ready for more interview type problems within the industry. It has only been a week and I feel like the workload was a bit heavy but having a clear understanding of what my work would look like for the week helped me alot and kept me away from stress. Throughout the week I felt very calm and prepared for the next piece of each assignment. If I am able to maintain each week like this past week then I think that this style of work and learning will work for me.
