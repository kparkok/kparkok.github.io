ICS 314 from UH Manoa was my introduction to functional programming, user interface frameworks, project management and software engineering as a whole.

##What is functional programming?

Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions, emphasizing immutability and avoiding changing state or mutable data. To simplify functional programming, functional programming uses functions and expressions to build programs.The idea behind it is to keep work simple and predictable, what you implement gives the same result every time, without changing anything else in the process. This class introduced me to the core concepts of functional programming such as higher-order functions and recursions, promoting a clean, predictable and testable code.
