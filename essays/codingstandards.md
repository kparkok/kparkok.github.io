## What are coding standards?

Coding standards is a set of guidelines that you should follow when writing and producing code and helps to write cleaner, more efficient and more readable code with fewer errors and bugs. Understanding coding standards is a very important skill and is extremely important when having to collaborate with others. One tool that we worked with this past week was ESLint.

ESLint is an analysis tool that helps to identify problems or code that doesn't adhere to the defined coding guidelines. So far I have found ESLint to be an extremely useful tool. It can feel overwhelming at times when having to stop your work to go back and fix their notes but overall helps me to produce clearer work. Overall, I've already come to see how beneficial ESLint can be to the future of my work. I think it's very easy for me to skip over the small errors that don't make a big difference but everytime I see how it can affect my work and ESLint helps me to avoid that.

Coding standards are definitely more than just a set of arbitrary rules. They are an essential tool for improving the quality and consistency of our work especially with the help of tools like ESLint. It helps us to keep a clear foundation of our work and takes away the stress of reaching dead ends.
